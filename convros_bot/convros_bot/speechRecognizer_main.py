# silero_sensitivity (float, default=0.6): Sensitivity for Silero's voice activity detection ranging from 0 (least sensitive) to 1 (most sensitive). Default is 0.6.
# webrtc_sensitivity (int, default=3): Sensitivity for the WebRTC Voice Activity Detection engine ranging from 0 (least aggressive / most sensitive) to 3 (most aggressive, least sensitive). Default is 3.
# min_length_of_recording (float, default=1.0): Specifies the minimum duration in seconds that a recording session should last to ensure meaningful audio capture, preventing excessively short or fragmented recordings.
